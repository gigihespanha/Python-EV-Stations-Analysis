## Project Objective

The goal of this study is to explore and analyze a **US Department of Energy dataset** of alternate fuel stations, with a primary focus on **electric vehicle (EV) charging stations**.

### Methodology and Key Analyses:

1.  **Initial Exploration:** Investigate and categorize different fuel types, locations, and other station properties within the dataset.
2.  **Data Filtering:** Use **Boolean masks** with the Pandas library to isolate only the public-access EV charging stations.
3.  **In-Depth Analysis:**
    * Determine the different types of **ownership** for public-access charging stations.
    * Identify which **U.S. states** have the highest number of charging stations.
    * Conduct a **mini-analysis** specifically focused on the West Coast.
